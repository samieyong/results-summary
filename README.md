## My process

I added my HTML Tags first. Then I started styling it from top to bottom.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I saw the problem that 100vh can cause on mobile display. So I replaced it with
100%

<!-- ```css
main {
  height: 100vh; ❌ /*causes problem on mobile display*/
}
```css
main {
  height: 100%; 👍 /*replaced with this*/
} -->

### Continued development

I would like to improve on making my project more responsive. Converting from desktop view to mobile view was really exciting. However, it wasn't really easy so I had to do more convertion to improve on it.

### Useful resources

Google was really helpful as I searched for solution for problem of 100vh
